Documentation for Assignment 2

The algorithm works by using a binary search to find a word with the matching prefix,
then using a linear search to find all words with that prefix. The linear search goes in
both directions of the array to reduce time complexity. 

To help the binary search find the target faster the search index starts at the
length of the dictionary/26 * the first letter of the prefix.

It was assumed that the dictionary would be in alphabetical order. 

Please note that the word list I used counted 'y' as being after 'j' in alphabetical order.
Without the words.sort() call in GenerateWordArray() prefixes containing a 'y' will not
work.
