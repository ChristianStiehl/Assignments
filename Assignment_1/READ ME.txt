Documentation for Assignment 1

The game itself is very straight forward, the physics aspect is handled mostly by 
Phasers P2 physics system. 

While working on the game I wanted to learn as much as possible about the features offered by
Phaser, learning functions and features that appear often in games. Some basic examples of 
this are audio, spritesheets, tweening and vector calculations.

Some more advanced examples are the texture cropping for the arrow indicator, 
this is something I wanted to know how to do as it is extremely handy when developing 
mobile games (progress bars & health bars etc.), and some light optimalization 
(disabling debug and clearBeforeRender, setting texture priorities etc.)

The code itself is still very messy and not of sufficient production quality. However
I am sure that I can learn to produce better and more structured code when provided
with some coding guidelines and mentoring by a potential employer.

I definitely spent more time on the small details and little things than the main
gameplay and physics aspect, I feel like this is a good representation of what I like in
game development. Polishing a game to make it feel fun to play is a key aspect of making
a good game in my opinion, of course polishing can only take a game so far, and it should 
always go hand in hand with great fundamentals and mechanics.
